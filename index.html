    <h1>Why looking after my family is an aggressive act of patriarchal oppression</h1>
    <p>When Viktor Frankl talked about who survived in the concentration camps at Auschwitz, he talked about people maintaining their positivity, and continuing to believe that there was any reason to go on.  He talked about healthy, able men and women who simply closed their eyes and faded away, and sickly victim types who looked like they wouldn't last another day walking out at the end of the war.</p>
    <p>So, my marriage is like the holocaust.</p>
    <p>Imagine that you replaced the food in Auschwitz with good, palatable meals.  No, that you stopped murdering people.  That would be better, right?  Now imagine that you stop murdering people AND you improve the food.  Then imagine that you implement games programs which are healthful and enjoyable.  And that you make improvement after improvement to the conditions in the camp.  After which improvement, do you think, would you be happy to stay there?  After which improvement would the prisoners all have a reason to live?</p>
    <p>Now put the concentration camp metaphor aside for the moment.  Imagine you had a good, happy life.  You're married, employed and your children are healthy.</p>
    <p>Now remove positive aspects of your imaginary life, one at a time.  You lose your job.  Your house has termites.  Your child gets sick.  After which reduction in life quality do you stop having a reason to live?</p>
    <p>I've worked with parents of very sick children, and they were still going on.  Many of us have lost our jobs, are we're still going on.  Most of the houses in the hills have termites, so...  Obviously it's not that.</p>
    <p>It's the one where you don't have control.</p>
    <p>It's the one where you don't have any choices.  It doesn't MATTER whether you're in a plush house at the time, or whether you're staring out through the wire at a minefield.  When you stop feeling that you have choices, you despair.</p>
    <p>Building a career is hard.  It takes luck, and long hours, and self awareness and maybe even some talent.  It's hard enough that just going to work every day feels like enduring deprivation, especially when your hobbies and your 'real life' are waiting at home.</p>
    <p>It's hard enough that you don't want to make it any harder.  When you get home after work, you don't want to work any more.  When it's the weekend, you want to rest.  That's the schedule you signed up for - five hard days, two days off.  If that doesn't come, life feels insufferable - the price of consenting to those five days away from your real life was the two days to enjoy the fruits of your labour.</p>
    <p>So you tell yourself this story that there's some kind of slow burn that the rest of the family is doing.  That because they're not working to the extreme peaks of adrenaline that you are they can keep rolling 24 hours a day, every day of the year.  And it's not because there's any actual reason to think that it would be the case, it's because you need it to be.</p>
    <p>But it's not actually ethical to choose not to have any more choices.  I'm skipping the part about whether there was a discussion, or it was obvious, or it's the only way it's going to work, or whatever.  Once you're at the point that you think she chose not to be able to choose any more, you've stumbled into non-consensual deep water.</p>
